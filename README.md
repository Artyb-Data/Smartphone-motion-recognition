# Smartphone-motion-recognition
ANN for smartphone motion recognition

To use this neural network download "Motion_detector.h5" from repository and open it with Keras/Tensorflow using 
keras.models.load_model()
keras.model.load_weight()
then check on the "test.csv" dataset (it was not used for training the ANN).

or

download the folder and hit "run all cells" in a Jupyter Notebook on local machine. The file will be reproduced in the folder with notebook.
